# \# bash-dump
Welcome to my bash-dump repository, I dump all my bash scripts here.

## \# coloring  
How to impliment the colors to my bash scripts:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Martan-van-Verseveld/bash-dump.git`
- Move the `.color` file to your `/etc` folder: `cd bash-dump && sudo mv .color /etc/`
now the colors should work in the bash scripts

## \# run scripts
There are 2 quite simple ways to run bash scripts:
- either `bash 'script'`
- or `chmod +x 'script'` than `./'script'`

## \# scripts
A list of all scripts I have made and uploaded:
- pingScript (Basicly useless, it asks you for the domain/ip to ping > the amount of times you want to ping it)
